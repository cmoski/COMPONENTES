Date: Fri 04.20.2012  Version: 2.4.8.150
======================================================================
Fixed up the ErrorChannel and QuadrantLines Line Studies as they were not scrolling to the edge of the chart properly.
Cleaned up the WPF VS2010 Project so that it is easier to work with (this is the main WPF project for M. Jordan)
Fixed some OnParameterChanged events for the StockChartX x and y axies.
Ticket 4654: Line style was not being changed on the vertical line study.
Ticket 4679: Added the ability to change the PanelMinHeight so that the user can hide a panel completely. Added Maximize, Minimize and Restore methods to the panel so that the user can play around with them programatically. Added a test case for this ticket to both the WPF and SL versions. 

Date: Tue 03.27.2012  Version: 2.4.7.141
======================================================================
Ticket 4625: When a panel was maximized the ClearAll() method was not returning the _maximizedPanel to null, causing the painting of the new chart to fail. Problem resolved. 
			 Also, a refresh button was added to the Silverlight test application to be able to test this bug. Will be useful for other tests.
Ticket 4560: Created a new tool in the Silverlight Demo/Example application for the users to be able to play with the text values on horizontal lines. Also had to change the access rights on a class so that it would work properly.
Cleaned up how the TickCompression is working for TimeCompression. When the tick data was added it's time stamp was used. Therefore, the interval would be set by the next tick and not from the previous one in the current data set. Now the control will only grow the chart by exact intervals of the tick period.
Added a new output enum for the output of the labels in the new calendar version. Allows the user to select the end of the period as the output label.
Propagated select-ability to Twin/Linked series.
Ticket 4636: There was a bug in the IsChartScrollerVisible property. It is now fixed.
Cleaned up the Silverlight Test Application again so that a lot of added tools would be able to be laid out properly. Also cleaned up the structure of the C# file to make things easier to find.
Cleaned up the error in the InfoPanel folowing the cursor.
Cleaned up an error in the scroller that was stopping the scroller from going all of the way to the right.
Cleaned up the random data feed so that it would have a few new features (messyness being one of them, useful for some testing).
Changed the display routines for the InfoPanel so that it does not go out of bounds as it was before.
Change the Sample/Demo app w.r.t. the height of initial panels as the new bit of code that limits them from getting too small was getting in the way.
Ticket 4638: Added a new tool to the Silverlight Sample/Demo application that shows some of the tools that are available for working with the Candle style properties.
Cleaned up the way that a candle displays on the screen. The border no longer takes up extra space, the wick has been split into two so that it does not display in the middle of the hollow bar.
Added a new variable to the system so that the user can select which color is used for the wick (the fill or the outline).
Added some more code to the Demo/Sample application that shows the different display possibilities for the standard price style.
Ticket 4581: TickBox was not moving to the correct location when the y-axis scale changed. The bug is resolved.
Ticket 4616: Made sure that extra small candles now have more information on the screen.

Date: Tue 03.13.2012  Version: 2.4.6.125
======================================================================
Ticket 4541: Changes from previous release were missed. They are being included in this release.
Ticket 4597: Changed how the popup windows for indicators work for the SL version of the application. Partly to match the WPF version and partly to have it more consistent for the users. The style controls and settings controls showed up on different popup windows at different times. Now all of the data shows up on one window at a time and all data points ara available.
	Also, the way that settings are handled for indicators that have 'twin' indicators is now set up properly. It should be automatica and intuative now.
Ticket 4596: Added the ability for the user to be able to delete Indicators directly from the chart. Again, this is a standardization between WPF and SL. In the WPF version a right click could be used, but as this is not advised, the double click or title bar click will now bring up the settings window that will have the new functionality to be able to delete the seleced indicator.
Changed the way that the panels reposition themselves when a panel is completely removed. The effect should be less jaring to the user.
Added a new Calendar to the system. There are some issues with how this calendar works (it may be a bit sparse for some users) but it does scan differently in a way that some users might prefer, and there are a lot more editable parameters for style and layout if the user wants to learn how to use them. A small demonstration has been added to the SL demo application to show some of the functionality.
Potential breaking change. Changed when the DeleteSeries even it fired. It was not being fired for all deletion events. Now it is, and it will also fire for Twin series. 

Date: Wed 02.29.2012  Version: 2.4.5.116
======================================================================
Breaking changed. The properties StockChart.TickPeriodicity and StockChart.TickCompressionType do not compress anymore the stored internally ticks.
		See internal comments why. Instead user is supposed to call the method StockChart.CompressTicks() after any of those 2 properties were changed.
Major structural change to the Dependency Properties. They are now more consistent for both WPF and SL versions. Any functionality in only one version is now in both.
Ticket 4489: Added a new set of dependency properties for the X and Y location of the Crosshairs so that clients can access the values and even change them externally. This also changed how the crosshair is drawn, no longer a timer, but on mouse events.
Ticket 4541: Added a new method to the Indicator class that will allow the client to find out about the Twin's Parent Indicator (called TwinsParentIndicator). There is also a new button in the SL example with a best practice piece of code.
Ticket 4541: Added a new dependancy property that will allow the client to turn off the Twin Indicator elements in the title bar of the panel (only one will show up and not many).
Ticket 4541: Added the required elements to the Serialization for saving and loading of the chart.
Ticket 4543: Bug Fix: Changed the way that the chart reacts when the user starts to draw a line study. Now the user will be able to change the location and scale of the chart before they start to draw. Also, the cursor has been changed so that it works in the SL version like in the WPF version (there is a cursor style change when the line studes are drawn).
Bug Fix: Added the URILicenseKey property to the Serialization routines for saving and loading of charts.
Ticket 4601: Bug fix: There was a problem with the Opacity and LinePattern for the standard series, and many of the line studies. All of the classes are now changed. If a user comes across a situation where these two properties are not working please alert support.
Ticket 4132: Added a new tool to the SL Example app for saving and applying indicators to charts.
Added 20 more indicators. Updated ta-sdk library.

Date: Tue 01.31.2012  Version: 2.4.4.106
======================================================================
Added a button to the Example project for ticket 4396.
Fixed a bug with regards to the programmatic creation of Line Studies during the loading of a chart. The application was throwing an exception due to -Infinity values. The values are now being captured and corrected in LineStudy.cs file.
Fixed a bug where a line study that is added to the far right of the chart would lock to the right and not move with the data as it was scrolled. Ticket 4394.
Changed the way the safe and re-load of the GeneralTemplate occurs so that the system will restore the data properly. Ticket 4132.

Date: Fri 12.30.2011  Version: 2.4.3.98
======================================================================
Fixed a but with the deploy process. The SL XAP file was not being added to the ZIP file and the BIN folder was not being created.
Slight change to the DemoApplication to stop showing the frame rate data.
Repaired the deployment XAP so that obfuscation is working properly.
Changed the Back end DLLs on the Silverlight Example Application to use the .NET v4 DLLs instead of the older ones.
Added a new structure to the example application that will allow for small bits of example code to be added for the clients.
Added a new dependency property to deal with the licensing of the SL product. Users will no loner need to edit the code to add their URI, they can instead go to http://www.modulusfe.com/support/getlicense.asp and create a license key for their opearing URL.
Added a button to the Example project for ticket 4360.

Date: Fri 12.09.2011  Version: 2.4.1.84
======================================================================
Added strongly types assemblies for all of the assemblies in the system. Source code users will have access to a non-secure key with the password ModulusFE.
Added Visual Studio 2010 upgrades. Many files were upgraded to new version, but many files still exist in an unsupported way.
Fixed a bug in the Silverlight version to turn on the Double click events.

Date: 12 Apr 2011 Version: 2.2.2.47
======================================================================
Added a possibility to zoom the chart using a zooming area like in old OCX chart.
Added new property Series.Panel, that returns a reference to the panel where the series is located.  
Fixed the case when the event LineStudyAdded wasn't raised for all LineStudies except HorizontalLine. Now it gets raised for all line studies. Other miscellaneous error in internal implementation.
